        Pseudocode
    </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Pseudocode is a method used to really break down the fundamentals of code, much like a recipe for a meal. It takes each function and step - but puts it in simpler terms to help you break down your code. It is a point of reference to look back to - telling you what your initial code was meant to look like in terms of function and process. A rough draft of what you intend to be doing. 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            This is very useful when doing code - as looking at code can sometimes be very daunting and confusing especially when you have been looking at that error of code for a long time. Referencing back to your pseudocode technique can simplify the error and can point you into the direction of how to fix the error. 
        </p>

        The rubber ducky method
    </h3>
         <p class="paragraph">
            I have found this method to be SO useful when I have been stuck on certain tasks throughout foundations (I have been talking to my plants). This method is used in quite similar methods like pseudocode but with more nuance on technical elements. It’s a task that simply - explain what you are doing, line by line, to the duck. With this process what you will find, is the places where you are finding difficulty in your code are the places that you are struggling to explain to your duck. This is also a method you can use with your friends who have no knowledge of software development. Explaining to a friend with the goal for them to understand what you are discussing, means that you fully understand what you are trying to achieve and perform.     
        </p>
    <h3 class="header3">
        Google 
    </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            This is a very obvious tool - but is also something that I didn’t realise is quite a good skill to develop or that it was a skill that even could be developed. Making your google searches more tailored for your specific needs, leads to a more streamlined problem solving method. Looking through the web endlessly for examples of code can be frustrating - so knowing where to look, or finding sites that work for you makes these instances easier and more fruitful.

        Asking for help
    </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Throughout this process of learning I have found that this is the last point of call, and sometimes all you need is a little nudge into the right direction or a little explanation of where you are going wrong. People learn in all different ways, and for myself - having a conversation with someone about a certain issue or task, is the best way for me to fully grasp what the problem may be. This is also learning other people's perspectives, learning other people's research methods or understanding that the task isn't actually as large as you thought it was. Asking peers for help is a learning model that I absolutely love, it creates a community that is based on help and support - and takes away any anxiety about being ‘less’.     
        </p>
    <h3 class="header3">
        Reflection
    </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">
            A very key technique in understanding and learning. Making this a habitual process in your functioning is such a wonderful way to progress and understand yourself mentaly and physically. Taking some time to list what struggles you dealt with and what processes you went through to fix those said problems - reinforces new strategies to overcome tasks. I have found that ending my days with reflection, or ending my tasks with reflections - enables me to understand how my brain navigates certain situations, so that for future tasks, I can understand an appropriate way to engage with.
