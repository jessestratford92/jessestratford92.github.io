</div>

<div>
    <h3 class="header3">What is the relationship between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">HTML, CSS, and Javascript all flow together and work as one. I like to think of their pairing in the analogy of a cutting edge tech home building company - each assigned within their team with their own roles. Builders/architects(HTML), interior designers(CSS) and then the electrician/home tech builders (JavaScript). HTML is the fundamentals of a website, designing the layout of the house, building the frames, placing the roof, and allocating the rooms. CSS is the decorating, what does the wallpaper look like, what is the flooring, is there a common design that is frequent in all rooms, or does each room have their own design rules. JavaScript are the electricians and tech designers - how does each room function and what happens inside of each of the rooms, security functions of keeping the house safe, how does each door open, how do the lights turn on and off and how is the heating controlled throughout the house? These workers make sure the features of the house are programmed in a way that makes for ease of living, but also interplaying and celebrating the HTML layout, and CSS design.</p>
    <h3 class="header3">Control flow and loops</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">The control flow is used as a way of ordering and executing statements in a script. In the running order for code; it is done from first the topline all the way through to the last line (much like an instruction manual - follow step by step to execute the desired outcome). What comes into play throughout this process are loops - these are in place to repeat certain steps or instructions until certain criteria are met. Loops are similar to the way a desired object might have different outcomes - whatever your desired outcome might be, loops will ensure you will stay inside of the guidelines of the manual, restrict certain outcomes, but lead you to the place you will be needing to head towards.</p>
    <h3 class="header3">Interacting with the DOM</h3>   
        <p class="paragraph">DOM (Document Object Model) is a tool used so that you can see a website's source code documents, and everything happening inside of a website. Through this tool (The DOM) we can see the inner workings of how HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more interplay with each-other. Understanding how to use this, means that you can manipulate a website through your browser to play with elements and understand how various web designs work. One thing that I have picked up myself is when building my own web files - results shown in the DOM point you to exactly where syntax errors are - so that you can fix them easier.</p>
    <h3 class="header3">The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Objects are used in a way to take representation of an ‘object’ in your code. This ‘object’ could be anything; a song, a building, a piece of clothing, a character in a game - really just basically something that is defined by a set of characteristics. For objects; these ‘characteristics’ are called properties that have the consistency of things like ‘key’ and ‘value’. You can access objects; change, add and remove or even manipulate the value. 
        <p class="paragraph">Arrays are used as a way to store a list of multiple items inside of a single variable. Think of this like your favorite band. Inside the band might consist of ‘guitar’, ‘vocals’, ‘keys’, and ‘bass’ - to access these instruments they are assigned with positions from 0-3 = 4 in total. When you ask a programe what is instrument 3?; ‘bass’ will turn up from the array from the list. You can then assign different values to this - like if the bass player plays both bass guitar and bass synth. The guitarist in position 0 might also do back-up vocals, you can assign that their value might be different from the array. The list might look something like this;</p>
            <li class="paragraph">Guitar; Guitar & backup vocals = 2 </li>
            <li class="paragraph">Vocals; Vocals = 1</li>
            <li class="paragraph">Keys; Keys = 1</li>
            <li class="paragraph">Bass; Bass, Synth = 2</li>
            <h3 class="header3">What are functions and why are they useful?</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">FUNCTIONS - a very important and integral building block for the functioning of JavaScript. How I like to think of a simpler way of understanding the way functions work; is the analogy of following a recipe from Nigella Lawson - her delicious Lemon Tart lol. What it’s all about is following a set of tasks/statements but taking in important ingredients into the process as well. Instructions from the recipe are followed step by step and the outcome - is a delicious Lemon Tart.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Functions aid in keeping clean code, and is an easy way to cut repeating commands - keeping code short saving heaps of time.</p>
