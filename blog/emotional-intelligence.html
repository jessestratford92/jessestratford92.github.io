    <h3 class="header3">EQ and IQ</h3>
    <h3 class="header3">What is emotional intelligence?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The capacity to be aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically. People with a high degree of emotional intelligence know what they’re feeling, what their emotions mean, and how these emotions can affect other people.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">For leaders, having emotional intelligence is essential for success. After all, who is more likely to succeed - a leader who shouts at his team when he is under stress, or a leader who stays in control, and can calmly assess the situation?</p> 
    <h3 class="header3">There are 5 key elements to emotional intelligence:</h3>
                    <li class="paragraph">Self-awareness</li>
                    <li class="paragraph">Self-regulation</li>
                    <li class="paragraph">Motivation</li>
                    <li class="paragraph">Empathy</li>
                    <li class="paragraph">Social skills</li> 
     <h3 class="header3">How is it different from IQ?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">Your IQ refers to your intellectual ability. Some of the most common elements of your IQ include your ability to:</p>
                    <li class="paragraph">Use logic to solve problems</li>
                    <li class="paragraph">Plan and strategy</li> 
                    <li class="paragraph">Understand abstract ideas</li>
                    <li class="paragraph">Learn and adapt to change</li>
                    <li class="paragraph">Grasp and use language</li> 
            <p class="paragraph">Having a high IQ in terms of workplace success has many advantages - and can help further your technical capabilities. How this differs from EQ is that none of this pertains to the understanding and function of one’s emotions and well-being.</p>
    <h3 class="header3">Why is it important?</h3> 
            <p class="paragraph">EQ is the workforce of any industry is very important. In my experience through tuition, IQ was always the main factor in performance - and EQ was never really taken into consideration. What I find so important with EQ is the drive it can help you with in achieving goals and keeping or raising standards. Having a maintained and good EQ can instill good influence, in keeping morale high for yourself and others. Self confidence is the highest of benefits that come from having good EQ, it maintains healthy standards in wellbeing, takes away self-doubt and helps others be confident in themselves.</p>
