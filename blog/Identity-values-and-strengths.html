    <p class="paragraph">My core personal values are summed up through the trials and tribulations in my life and what I have experienced so far. A situation where I had an ethical decision to make, was when I noticed that I could not pursue music full time - and had to find another means of income that would still give me the same values that music has for me. This was making the decision to come into Dev Academy - I am taking what I love most doing, and applying my skills from this - into a relative department that has more reachable career targets and goals. The consequence here is at this current time, having no job and living off studylink/savings - but I do know that if I commit myself to this, it is going to further me in both Web Development work, and also music work.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">My culture is important to me; I currently reside in an artist environment where me and my peers all collaborate and push each-other to pursue our dreams and goals.  This for me is so important, as having a community that becomes culture helps lift moral, engagement, relationships and wellbeing. Iâ€™ve learnt from being in this culture of creative link minded people - that support is key.</p>    
    <p class="paragraph">My strengths lie in my determination to succeed but also making sure that whatever I'm doing - I actually enjoy doing. I have never understood the concept of being uncomfortable in your work environment and pursuing onwards inside of it. My limitations lie with my distracted nature, where I will get carried away doing something else without even realizing. Being strict on myself in task management is key to making sure I don't stray away from tasks - but is definitely something I'm still learning.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">An experience where I found resistance and tension in a group instance - was definitely doing some assignments at CoCa Massey University. We were put into groups of complete opposite instrumentation and backgrounds - and had to navigate making music together. This was difficult - as creatives can be stubborn at times, and can get quite offended if their ideas are not heard or developed. The way that I found was best in working with these obstacles, was making sure that everyone had their role - and each and every single person's idea was heard. Making an open and communicative learning / creating environment is key.</p>
