<div>
    <p class="paragraph">My long-term goal is to be working inside of the tech industry - in an environment that caters towards my lifestyle and interests. Working as a web-developer is attractive to me as it brings forth my interest in future technologies. I want to bring my skills as a creative learner, thinker and viewer - into this experience and take grasp of a really exciting opportunity."></p>
    <p class="paragraph"> A strength of mine is that I definitely see things visually and can make sense of formulas by structure and layout. What limits me though, is that I can get too distracted by aesthetics and at this stage, it gets me into problems with jumping ahead when I should stick to basics. I constantly have to tell myself to not get carried away.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Iâ€™ve always really enjoyed working as apart of a team - my time managing in hospitality has given me confidence with this. What I want to learn from being at dev academy is what a team is, how a team functions, and how a team thrives in a tech scenario.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"> I was very unlucky in my second week, during sprint 2..and unfortunately pulled a nerve in my neck that held me unworkable for four days.  During this period I was stressed and unable to leave my bed in recovery - but came back into work again on the Monday when sprint 3 was meant to start - with sprint 2 already needing to be submitted. It is Tuesday now, and I have nearly finished sprint 2 - with the help, support and guidance from my facilitator Naomi. Four things I have learnt that are of most importance when working at this rate/level are POSTURE, PERSISTENCE, PEACE, and PATIENCE.  Always ask for help if you are struggling, and never be too hard on yourself. 
        I have taken a step back from my directing role as a part of a contemporary dance work - so that I can fully commit to this course. This was a hard decision, but it ensures more time for the fast paced learning environment.</p>
