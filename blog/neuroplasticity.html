    <h3 class="header3">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
        <p class="paragraph">Neuroplasticity is an umbrella term that is used to refer to the brain's ability of modifying, changing and adaptability in both structure and function throughout one's life. Understanding these principles allows oneself to graduate from previous learning or thought patterns - to allow oneself to achieve a new mindset that could be more beneficial to a person's mental health/growth and physical understanding of one's nature. In many cases we are told that we ‘inherit’ brain function, and that a lot is unachievable if you have a brain that works a certain way that might not fit the normality of certain learning environments. What understanding neuroplasticity is - is that our brains can be molded like plastic, it breaks down classical learning models and enables us to learn new pathways or expand parts of your brain to achieve better functionality and performance. 
        </p>
    <h3 class="header3">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit
    </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">This is quite an important topic of study for myself - as growing up, I had never felt that typical learning models were very accessible or encouraging for my kind of brain. Keeping up in this system, just meant for self-doubt and as a result of that, lower academic performance was achieved in comparison to other students. How I would like to engage with these principles of neuroplasticity is the method through rewarding thoughts and understanding goal setting in a healthy way. I like the principle of taking away the thought of ‘I cannot do this task’ and replacing it with ‘I cannot do this task YET’. Replacing the end goal of ‘FAIL’ with the end goal of ‘Not Yet’ is much more encouraging, and makes the task of learning less daunting and panic filled. 
        </p>
        <h3 class="header3">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
    </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">A way in which to increase your neuroplasticity is to switch your mindset, switch your learning style, and find a way that specifically works for you. This can be ways like working in more of a community based style of learning.  Making learning not only a ‘self’ based system, but a system where each all learns with one another, and goals are set as a team. This enables support and understanding for one another and promotes an overall more healthy way to look at difficult tasks or learning obstacles.
        </p>
    <h3 class="header3">But why this is relevant?
    </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">This is so relevant in our current day and age where learning models are only seeing a slow change in our overall system of education. We as a community all learn differently, and understanding that a huge part of the population does not fit into the mold of neuro-typical learning methods - we need to be more inclusive for other individuals who don’t fit into that structure. Everyone has the capability to succeed and grow, it’s just a far harder task for some who have a particular way of understanding and learning
        </p>
    <h3 class="header3">How will I integrate a growth mindset into my study?
    </h3>
        <p class="paragraph">I really want to make this quite a large focus for myself throughout my journey in Dev-Academy. Not only to finally test out different ways of learning, but also to see what I am actually capable of. It's new to me to discuss these topics, and it excites me to learn in such an understanding environment. I will tackle the largest issue of mine - that is panic of outcome. Finding ways to navigate this thought pattern will allow me to flourish without having a ‘ball and chain’ attached to myself whilst learning. I will also understand that sometimes I will want to rest and recover - making a healthy set time for myself to ‘log off’ and keep my inner child happy whilst performing heavy loads of tasks and information.
